Once, I tried using Python and Django, then Php with Laravel, and Php with Symfony. In all these attempts, I always ended up in the same place, overcomplicating things when it wasnâ€™t necessary. ðŸ˜…\nAfter doing some research, I decided to use Go and Hugo. In this blog post, I will discuss my experience building it.\nBenefits of Go and Hugo Go is this super speedy programming language, and Hugo is a static site generator built with Go. These two tools helped me create a website thatâ€™s fast, reliable, and easy to maintain. One of the coolest things about Hugo is that it lets you separate content and layout, so you donâ€™t need to sweat the technical stuff when youâ€™re creating content. Plus, since Hugo generates static websites, you donâ€™t need a database or server-side processing, making it free to host it. Pretty neat, huh?\nDeveloping the Website To develop it, I first had to install Go and Hugo locally. I followed the quick start in the Hugo documentation. I will not try to explain it. They already did a superb job; check out the doc if you want to know more.\nFrom the template side, I wanted to go for something as simple as possible - remember that I tend to overcomplicate things? Yeah, thatâ€™s why I looked for the simplest one.\nFrom there, I added some content. This process was more straightforward because Hugo uses Markdown for content creation. Markdown is a simple syntax for formatting text that is easy to learn and use. - If you had to write a README for a Github Repo, you know what Iâ€™m talking about*\nDeployment Once my website was complete, I needed to deploy it. Because Hugo generates static websites, I could deploy my website using Github pages. It is a free way to host static websites. I followed the instructions on how to set it up with a custom domain in the official documentation. Additionally, because the website is static, it is more secure and less vulnerable to attacks than a traditional dynamic website. - Thank you, Microsoft GitHub, for the free hosting ðŸ˜›\nConclusion Developing my website with Go and Hugo was pretty good! I was able to create it fast and efficiently. If youâ€™re thinking about making your own website, you should try Go and Hugo - theyâ€™re the coolest guys in town! ðŸ˜Ž\n","wordCount":"448","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-12T22:15:36+01:00","dateModified":"2023-01-12T22:15:36+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cdutten.github.io/web/posts/don-t-overcomplicate-your-web-resume-creation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"cdutten","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdutten.github.io/web/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://cdutten.github.io/web/ accesskey=h title="cdutten (Alt + H)">cdutten</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://cdutten.github.io/web/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://cdutten.github.io/web/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Don't overcomplicate your web resume creation</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-12 22:15:36 +0100 +0100'>January 12, 2023</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In today&rsquo;s world, having your website is not only a great way to showcase your work but also a way to make yourself more visible.
